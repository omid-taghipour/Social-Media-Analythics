        "# Project Overview\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "In our increasingly connected world, the rise of hate speech sharing has become a pressing concern. The digital world, with its vast amount of communication channels, has given way to new forms of harassment and intimidation. This project aims to benefit from the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to predict instances of hate speech. Moreover, exploration of the unique words and patterns embedded in the language of hate speech will be embarked on to better understand this problem's nature and characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goal of the Project\n",
        "Goal of the project is to investigate Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies to identify hate speech. As well as identifying hate speech, we tend to investigate the linguistic aspects of the hate speech to understand deeper nature and characteristics of this topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "### 1. Data\n",
        "During this project, we will use the [`Hate Speech Detection curated Dataset🤬`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waalbannyantudre/hate-speech-detection-curated-dataset) available on the Kaggle repository for the people to use. Dataset has been already neutralized to remove information about the people to follow privacy right of the people. The original dataset is available at [Mendely website](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9sxpkmm8xn/1). Additionally, the dataset has been used in the [**A curated dataset for hate speech detection on social media text** article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922010356) that focused on hate speech recognition also. Further information about the characteristics of the dataset will be given in the corresponding section of the project.\n",
        "#### Dataset Citation\n",
        "Mody, Devansh; Huang, YiDong; Alves de Oliveira, Thiago Eustaquio (2022), “A Curated Hate Speech Dataset”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/9sxpkmm8xn.1\n",
        "### 2. Data Preprocessing\n",
        "Like all other data science projects there will be data preprocessing to reshape data into a form that can be understood by the machine learning models better.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "As first step of this project, we will implement sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis calculates polarity score of the text. Calculated scores identify if text is positive, neutral, or negative. We expect the result of sentiment analysis to be negative for texts labeled as hate speech and positive for texts labeled as not hate speech.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Topic Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Classification using Machine Learning\n",
        "As the last step of this project, we will investigate classification using machine learning models. We will implement two different machine learning models and tune their parameters. After training models, each model will be tested individually with the test dataset. Results of the models' prediction will be used in evaluation of models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Significance\n",
        "Understanding and predicting hate speech is crucial for fostering a safer online environment. By developing an accurate model and uncovering linguistic patterns, we can contribute to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of hate speech, protect individuals from harm, and promote positive digital interactions\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Note: This part served as an introduction to our NLP project. Subsequent sections will delve into the technical details, results, and implications of our work.*."
